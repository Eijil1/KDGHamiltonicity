	<h1>Are 1-Delaunay graph hamiltonian ?</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
			As some researchers !!Source Abellanas et al. (2009) !! conjuctured that 1-Delaunay graphs are Hamiltonian, it is yet not shown. The aim of the application is to allow a user to experiment on the hamiltonicity of k-Delaunay graph. In this report, the application will be introduce, as well as the different algorithms used in its implementation.

		<h2>Presentation</h2>
			<p>The tool is quite simple to use. The user may add points to the drawing area by clicking at the desired position or by entering coordinates in the input fields on the very top and then clicking on the "Add" button. Adding the points by coordinates allows to have more accuracy in the drawing. The user should just be aware that the coordinate system used is the same as in javascript : x growing from left to right and y from top to bottom. If the user tries to add a point outside of the drawing area (outside of the window or above the line), nothing will happen.</p>
			<p>Once they are satified by the layout, the "Compute k-DG" button allows to display the k-Delaunay graph. They may choose the value of k in the input field on the left of the button. If the input is not . Eventually the "Compute Hamiltonian cycle" button will display an hamiltonian cycle in the graph if there is one.</p>
			<p>The "Clear" button will clear everything that has been drew.</p>
